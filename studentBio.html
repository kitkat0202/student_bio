            <p>I am driven by the desire to succeed and am eager to apply my strong leadership experiences, and interpersonal skills to achieve this success. I always look forward to new experiences and further developing my professional and soft skills.</p>
            <p>As treasurer of Asian American Student Union I acquired strong leadership and interpersonal skills. I am able to think quickly in emergency situations and in those requiring quick assessment of many factors in order to make appropriate decisions. Dealing with the diverse concerns of students and faculty, I have become adept at operating with the proper mix of authority, diplomacy, and tact. I am responsible, dedicated and open to learning new skills. The leadership position, in AASU, is one of the many opportunities that I have taken up to expand my professional skills. I have also worked with and lead many other organizations and clubs.</p>
